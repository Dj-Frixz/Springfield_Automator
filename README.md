# Springfield Automator

### A little project I made in one day inspired by the impossible 'Springfield Heights' missions from EA's mobile game The Simpsons™: Tapped Out
I finished the main story a long ago but I was so sick of these side quests popping out (and trying completing them in vain) that I decided to create a bot which would grind while afk. This is just a fun project not a hack, and doesn't have any intent of breaking the game.
<br><br>

## How to install
- Install an android emulator on your PC if you don't have one (I chose Memu because it's the only one that doesn't make the app crash while loading my massive Springfield)
- Install The Simpsons™: Tapped Out on your emulator
- Check if you have Python 3 installed on your PC, if you don't find it download and install the last version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Run setup.py
<br><br>

## How to use
- Enter the game and make it fullscreen (<kbd>F11</kbd> on the keyboard)
- Run script.py and switch to the emulator window (<kbd>Alt+Tab</kbd> on the keyboard)
- To stop it press the right mouse button for a few seconds
- To see if it actually stopped see if the python window has disappeared
- If for some reasons it doesn't stop just exit the emulator window or switch window and the bot should pause. Now press again the right mouse button and if it still doesn't work do <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> on the script.py window or close that window or terminate the process in the resource manager or in the command prompt

## How to setup your Springfield and best practises to reduce errors
- Make a big clean area on the edge of the map with as less visible buildings and walking characters as possible, and put there all the Springfield Heights buildings in a 'block', with some space. They should be more spaced horizontally than vertically (supposing that you don't have a vertical monitor lol)
- Ensure that the hammers on each building are clearly visible and not over some dark textures (ex. the smoke from the chimneys)
- I suggest placing Simpsons house near the block, to set the spawnpoint there (will be more useful in a future update)
